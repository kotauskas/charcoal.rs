//! Utilities for treating the backing storage for trees generically.
//!
//! This module is home for the following items:
//! - [`Storage`], the main trait for the backing storages for trees
//! - [`ListStorage`], a trait used for implementing `Storage` for list-like collections
//! - [`SparseStorage`], a wrapper around `ListStorage`s which greatly improves element removal performance
//! - [`DefaultStorage`], a type definition for the default backing storage used by trees unless a different one is specified; takes different values depending on feature flags
//!

/// Trait for various kinds of containers which can be the backing storage for trees.
///
/// # Safety
/// There's a number of invariants which have to be followed by the container:
/// - The length of the storage cannot be modified in the container when it's borrowed immutably or not borrowed at all;
/// - `new` and `with_capacity` ***must*** return empty storages, i.e. those which have `len() == 0` and `is_empty() == true`;
/// - it should be impossible for the length of the storage to overflow `usize`;
/// - Calling [`get_unchecked`] or [`get_unchecked_mut`] if `contains_key` on the same key returns `true` should *not* cause undefined behavior (otherwise, it may or may not â€” that is implementation specific);
/// - Calling `remove` if `contains_key` on the same key should *never* panic, as that might leave the tree in an invalid state during some operations;
/// - If an element is added at a key, it must be retrieveable in the exact same state as it was inserted until it is removed or modified using a method which explicitly does so.
///
/// Tree structures may rely on those invariants for safety.
