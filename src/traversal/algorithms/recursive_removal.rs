/// # Panics
/// - If the traversable which is being visited incorrectly implements `TraversableMut`, especially `CAN_REMOVE_INDIVIDUAL_CHILDREN` and `parent_of`.
/// - If removing the root node is attempted. If all nodes in a tree need to be removed recursively, it can just be dropped instead.
///
/// # Algorithm details
/// There are two variants of the algorithm, one which runs only if [`CAN_REMOVE_INDIVIDUAL_CHILDREN`] is true and another which runs if it's false.
///
/// Here's how the `CAN_REMOVE_INDIVIDUAL_CHILDREN` algorithm runs:
/// - Start the cursor at the node to remove (*starting the cursor at a different node is a logic error*)
/// - For every traversal step:
///     - If the node at the cursor is a leaf node:
///         - Remove the node immediately
///         - If the node removed was the target node, **end the traversal**, returning the value of the just-removed node
///         - Otherwise, move the cursor to the parent node of the node which has just been removed and **end traversal step, awaiting next iteration**
///     - If the node at the cursor is a branch node:
///         - Try to remove the node together with its children
///             - If it failed because there was a branch child node, move the cursor to that node and **end traversal step, awaiting next iteration**
///             - Otherwise, if the branch node removed was the target node, **end the traversal**, returning the value of the just-removed node
///             - Otherwise, if the target node was among the removed leaf nodes, **end the traversal**, returning the required leaf node
///             - Otherwise, move the cursor to the parent node of the branch node which has just been removed and **end traversal step, awaiting next iteration**
///
/// Here's how the fallback algorithm runs:
/// - Start the cursor at the node to remove (*starting the cursor at a different node is a logic error*)
/// - For every traversal step:
///     - If the node at the cursor is a leaf node, move the cursor to the parent node of the node and **end traversal step, awaiting next iteration**
///     - If the node at the cursor is a branch node:
///         - Try to remove the children of the branch node, turning it into leaf
///             - If it failed because there was a branch child node, move the cursor to that node and **end traversal step, awaiting next iteration**
///             - Otherwise, if the target node was among the removed leaf nodes, **end the traversal**, returning the required leaf node
